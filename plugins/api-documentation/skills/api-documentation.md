## OpenAPI patterns

### Multiple examples per endpoint

```yaml
requestBody:
  content:
    application/json:
      examples:
        minimal:
          summary: Smallest valid request
          value: { ... }
        full:
          summary: All optional fields populated
          value: { ... }
        edge_case:
          summary: Common edge case
          value: { ... }
```

### Error response template

```yaml
'400':
  description: Bad request
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/Error'
      examples:
        validation_error:
          value:
            code: VALIDATION_ERROR
            message: line_items must contain at least one item
            errors: [{ field: line_items, code: MIN_LENGTH }]
            request_id: req_a8f3
```

### Versioning

URL-based (`/v2/orders`) is the easiest for tooling. Header-based (`Accept: application/vnd.acme.v2+json`) is cleaner but harder for clients.

## Getting-started template

```markdown
# Getting started

## What you'll build
A working integration that creates an order and handles the webhook.

## Prerequisites
- API key (sign up at acme.com/signup)
- curl or HTTP client
- ~30 minutes

## 1. Authenticate
[Working curl command, copy-paste-runnable, with placeholder for their key]
Expected response: { ... }

## 2. Create your first order
[Working curl]
Expected: order created, response shows id

## 3. Handle the webhook
[Sample webhook payload]
[Signature verification example in TypeScript]

## What's next
- Authentication options → ...
- Full API reference → ...
- Language SDKs → ...
```

## Error message format

```json
{
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Human-readable summary",
  "errors": [{ "field": "...", "code": "...", "details": "..." }],
  "request_id": "req_..."
}
```

`request_id` lets users reference the specific request in support tickets.

## Changelog format

## Common mistakes catalog

### "Docs are out of date"
Likely: docs not in version control or not in PR review. Move docs to repo. Reviewers must approve doc changes alongside code.

### "Developers can't find anything"
IA problem. Apply Diátaxis. Audit each page's category.

### "Examples don't work"
Examples aren't tested. Move examples to tested code (doctest, snippet tests). Run in CI.

### "Authentication confused everyone"
Auth is the highest-bounce page. Spend disproportionate effort. Include multiple auth methods if you support them.

### "Error responses are useless"
"Invalid request" tells nothing. Error catalog with structured codes + actions tells everything.
